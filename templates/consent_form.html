    <h2>STUDY TEAM</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Principal Investigator: </b> Dr. Angelica Lim (<a href="mailto:angelica@sfu.ca">angelica@sfu.ca</a>)</li>
        <li><b>Research Personnel: </b> Roya Javadi (<a href="mailto:angelica@sfu.ca">rjavadi@sfu.ca</a>), Emma Hughson
            (<a href="mailto:angelica@sfu.ca">ehughson@sfu.ca</a>)
        </li>

    </ul>
    <h2>TASK DETAILS</h2>
    <p>You are invited to take part in our study that helps to classify negative emotions of Contempt, Anger and Disgust
        (CAD) in three different cultures of North American, Persian and Filipino. We are looking for participants to
        label short clips, and select the expressions that are seen in each clip.
    </p>

    <h2>RESEARCH PURPOSE</h2>
    <p> We want to develop an effective model that is able to classify CAD emotions in these cultures. We want to
        extract
        prominent social signals of these cultures for each emotion. We want to investigate how individualistic scores
        of each culture affects CAD expressions in that culture.
    </p>

    <h2>VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION AND RIGHT TO WITHDRAW</h2>
    <p> Your participation is entirely voluntary. You can withdraw at any time without no negative consequences or any
        penalty for doing so. If you choose to enter the study and then decide to withdraw at a later time, it will not
        be possible to remove the annotations you have already completed, as it will have been stored anonymously.
    </p>

    <h2>PROCEDURE</h2>
    <p>If you say <b>“Yes,” </b> is how we will do the study: </p>
    <br>
    <ul>
        <li>The study will take place through an online web application, and you will be asked to complete it by filling
            out the forms.
        </li>
        <li>First, you have to register with a (preferably simple and anonymous) username and password and enter general
            information about yourself (e.g. language, background culture, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>Then you will be asked to login, and after successful login you will be redirected to annotation page in
            order to begin labelling short videos (each video is 1 to 5 seconds).
        </li>
        <li>Each culture has about 80 clips.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The estimated time for each task is 2 minutes.
    </p>

    <h2>RISKS/DISCOMFORTS</h2>
    <p>We do not think there is anything in this study that could harm you, and there are no foreseeable risks to you in
        participating. If you decide to take part in this research study and are unable to complete it, you may end the
        study by closing the browser tab and informing the researcher. </p>

    <h2>BENEFITS</h2>
    <p>Although it may not directly benefit you, this study may benefit society by improving the ability of intelligent
        agents that interact with humans in emotion recognition, which could be embedded into future technologies and
        provide better user experience.
    </p>
    <p class="text-primary"><b>Moreover, you can submit your email upon completion of the annotation task to enter into
        a draw for a 50$ gift
        card.</b></p>

    <h2>CONFIDENTIALITY</h2>
    <p>
        There is no identifying information in this study. Some general information will be stored in a secure database
        about you. The authentication mechanism purpose in this project is only to keep track of your progress. The main
        study findings will be published in academic journal articles and present at academic conferences. We will
        remove any possibility to obtain the original person’s information, and the anonymized data obtained from this
        study (tapping data and survey data) will be kept indefinitely on a web-based repository (e.g. SFU Vault or
        Radar) to be preserved for future use in open access initiatives.

    </p>

    <h2>INCLUSION AND EXCLUSION CRITERIA</h2>
    <p>We set inclusion criteria as all workers over the age of 19 years old, with a computer, that are related and
        familiar with one of three cultures: North American, Filipino or Persian, and are located in Canada.</p>
    <p>
        You will be excluded from this study if you do not know any of English, Tagalog or Persian languages.
